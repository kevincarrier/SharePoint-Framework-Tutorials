<ul>
    <li>Build Process and Tooling
        <ul>
            <li>Yeoman is used to replace the new project experience that traditional server-side SharePoint developers are familiar with in Visual Studio.</li>
            <li>Gulp is a task runner that replaces the tool MSBuild used in .NET solutions. This is used to run various tasks, like transpiling TypeScript to JavaScript, creating JavaScript bundles and SharePoint packages.</li>
            <li>Node.js is the underlying runtime used by all applications. The tools we're covering in this section are all built on top of Node.js. Node.js is required to run them, just like the .NET Framework is required to run .NET apps.</li>
            <li>NPM is used as the package manager and you'll use it to install global tools and reusable code in your projects.</li>
            <li>Webpack is used to combine all the JavaScript and CSS files in your project into a single JavaScript bundle. Bundles are the recommended way to deploy client-side applications for performance reasons.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Web Frameworks
        <ul>
            <li>When building client-side applications, developers commonly use web frameworks. The SharePoint Framework doesn't limit you to any specific framework. You can use any of the popular web frameworks in your projects including React, Angular, Knockout, or Vue.js. You can even use the popular jQuery library in your custom apps.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Code Editor
        <ul>
            <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
